## Abstract

This research examines leadership readiness for artificial intelligence (AI) transformation in Japanese and Vietnamese organizations. The study addresses a gap in understanding how leaders prepare for AI adoption in culturally distinct Asian markets. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research surveyed 428 leaders and conducted 45 in-depth interviews across both countries. Data analysis employed Python programming with comprehensive statistical libraries including pandas, NumPy, SciPy, statsmodels, and scikit-learn for quantitative analysis, while QualCoder software supported qualitative thematic analysis. The findings reveal that leadership readiness comprises four distinct dimensions: technological competence, change management capability, ethical awareness, and adaptive learning orientation. Results show significant differences between Japanese and Vietnamese leaders in their readiness profiles, with Japanese leaders demonstrating higher technological competence (M=4.18 vs. M=3.80, d=0.50) but lower adaptive learning orientation (M=3.63 vs. M=4.05, d=-0.58). Vietnamese leaders show stronger change management capabilities (M=4.16 vs. M=3.82, d=-0.44) but face greater ethical awareness challenges (M=3.90 vs. M=4.18, d=0.39). The research contributes a validated Leadership Readiness for AI Transformation (LRAIT) framework and provides actionable insights for organizations navigating digital transformation in Asian contexts. The study extends existing leadership theory by integrating AI-specific competencies with cultural dimensions and offers practical implications for leadership development programs.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Background of the Study

Organizations worldwide face pressure to adopt artificial intelligence technologies. This pressure stems from competitive demands, operational efficiency needs, and changing customer expectations (Davenport & Ronanki, 2018). AI technologies now influence decision-making processes, automate routine tasks, and create new business models across industries (Fountaine et al., 2019). However, technology alone does not guarantee successful transformation. Leaders play a central role in guiding organizations through AI adoption (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021).

The success of AI transformation depends on leadership readiness. Leaders must understand the technology, manage organizational change, address ethical concerns, and foster a culture of continuous learning (Dwivedi et al., 2021). Yet many organizations struggle with AI implementation due to inadequate leadership preparation (Ransbotham et al., 2020). This gap between AI potential and actual implementation creates significant challenges for businesses attempting digital transformation.

Asia presents a unique context for studying leadership readiness for AI transformation. The region shows both rapid technological adoption and distinct cultural characteristics that influence leadership practices (Holtbrügge & Mohr, 2010). Japan and Vietnam offer interesting comparative cases. Japan possesses advanced technological infrastructure and a mature economy, while Vietnam demonstrates rapid economic growth and increasing digital adoption (World Bank, 2022). Both countries share Asian cultural roots but differ in their organizational cultures, leadership traditions, and stages of economic development.

Japanese organizations operate within a context of long-standing business practices, hierarchical structures, and consensus-driven decision-making (Peltokorpi & Hasu, 2016). These characteristics influence how Japanese leaders approach technological change. Vietnamese organizations reflect a younger, more dynamic business environment shaped by rapid economic reform and increasing global integration (Nguyen & Aoyama, 2014). Understanding how leaders in these distinct contexts prepare for AI transformation provides valuable insights for both theory and practice.

Prior research on AI adoption has focused on Western contexts, creating a knowledge gap regarding Asian leadership practices (Li, 2022). Existing studies examine technical aspects of AI implementation or general change management but rarely address the specific leadership competencies required for AI transformation in Asian settings (Haenlein & Kaplan, 2019). This research fills that gap by examining leadership readiness across two culturally distinct Asian markets.

### 1.2 Research Problem

Organizations invest billions in AI technologies, yet many implementations fail to deliver expected value (Fountaine et al., 2019). Research indicates that 70% of AI projects do not move beyond pilot stages (Ransbotham et al., 2020). Leadership inadequacy contributes to these failures. Leaders often lack the necessary competencies to guide AI transformation (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021).

The problem becomes more acute in Asian contexts where cultural factors intersect with leadership practices. Japanese and Vietnamese organizations face unique challenges in AI adoption due to their cultural values, organizational structures, and leadership traditions (Li, 2022). Yet we lack a comprehensive framework that captures the leadership readiness dimensions specific to AI transformation in these contexts.

Current leadership development programs often apply Western models without considering cultural nuances (Ardichvili & Kuchinke, 2002). This approach creates a mismatch between training content and actual leadership needs in Asian organizations. The absence of culturally informed frameworks limits the effectiveness of leadership development efforts for AI transformation.

Three specific problems emerge from this situation. First, organizations cannot assess their leaders' readiness for AI transformation systematically. Without a clear framework, companies struggle to identify gaps in leadership capabilities. Second, leadership development programs lack guidance on which competencies to prioritize for AI transformation in specific cultural contexts. Third, organizations miss opportunities to learn from comparative insights between different Asian markets.

### 1.3 Research Objectives

This research aims to develop and validate a framework for leadership readiness for AI transformation in Japanese and Vietnamese contexts. The study pursues four specific objectives:

**Objective 1:** Identify the key dimensions of leadership readiness for AI transformation through literature synthesis and exploratory qualitative research.

**Objective 2:** Develop and validate a measurement instrument for assessing leadership readiness for AI transformation (LRAIT) in Japanese and Vietnamese organizational contexts.

**Objective 3:** Compare leadership readiness profiles between Japanese and Vietnamese leaders to understand cultural influences on AI transformation readiness.

**Objective 4:** Examine the relationship between leadership readiness dimensions and organizational AI adoption outcomes in both countries.

### 1.4 Research Questions

The research addresses four primary questions:

**RQ1:** What are the critical dimensions of leadership readiness for AI transformation in Japanese and Vietnamese organizations?

**RQ2:** How do leadership readiness dimensions differ between Japanese and Vietnamese leaders?

**RQ3:** What cultural and contextual factors explain the differences in leadership readiness between the two countries?

**RQ4:** How does leadership readiness relate to organizational success in AI transformation initiatives?

### 1.5 Significance of the Study

This research makes several important contributions. From a theoretical perspective, the study extends leadership theory by integrating AI-specific competencies with cultural dimensions. Existing leadership models do not address the unique demands of AI transformation (Dwivedi et al., 2021). This research fills that gap by identifying leadership readiness dimensions specific to AI adoption in Asian contexts.

The study also contributes to cross-cultural management literature. By comparing Japanese and Vietnamese leaders, the research illuminates how cultural factors shape leadership readiness for technological change. These insights advance our understanding of how cultural context influences leadership development and organizational change processes.

Methodologically, the research contributes a validated instrument for measuring leadership readiness for AI transformation. The LRAIT scale provides researchers and practitioners with a reliable tool for assessing leadership capabilities in AI contexts. This instrument can be adapted and applied in other cultural settings.

From a practical standpoint, the research provides actionable insights for organizational leaders, human resource professionals, and leadership development specialists. The framework helps organizations assess their current leadership readiness and identify areas requiring development. The comparative findings between Japan and Vietnam offer guidance for multinational companies operating in Asian markets.

The study also benefits policymakers and educational institutions. Understanding leadership readiness requirements for AI transformation informs curriculum development for business schools and executive education programs. Policy insights can guide national strategies for digital transformation and workforce development.

### 1.6 Scope and Limitations

This research focuses on mid-level and senior leaders in organizations pursuing or planning AI transformation initiatives in Japan and Vietnam. The study examines leadership readiness across multiple industries to ensure broad applicability. However, several limitations apply.

First, the research focuses on two countries. While Japan and Vietnam provide valuable comparative insights, findings may not generalize to other Asian or global contexts without further validation. Second, the study examines leadership readiness at a specific point in time. AI technologies evolve rapidly, and leadership requirements may shift as the technology matures.

Third, the research relies on self-reported measures for leadership readiness dimensions. While the study employs multiple validation methods, social desirability bias may influence responses. Fourth, the research examines organizations already engaged in AI initiatives. Leaders in organizations that have not yet begun AI transformation may possess different readiness profiles.

Finally, the study focuses on leadership readiness rather than broader organizational factors. While leadership plays a central role in AI transformation, other factors such as organizational structure, resource availability, and technical infrastructure also influence outcomes. This research acknowledges these factors but does not examine them in depth.

## Chapter 2: Literature Review

### 2.1 Introduction

This chapter reviews existing literature on leadership readiness for AI transformation. The review examines three primary bodies of knowledge: leadership theory and competencies, artificial intelligence transformation in organizations, and cross-cultural management in Asian contexts. The chapter begins by exploring how leadership has been conceptualized in the digital era and identifies the competencies researchers associate with effective digital leadership.

Next, the review examines literature on AI transformation, including adoption challenges, implementation processes, and success factors. This section pays attention to leadership's role in AI initiatives. The chapter then explores cross-cultural management theory, focusing on Asian leadership practices and cultural dimensions that influence organizational change.

The literature review serves three purposes. First, it establishes the theoretical foundation for the research. Second, it identifies gaps in existing knowledge that this study addresses. Third, it provides the basis for developing the research framework and hypotheses. The chapter concludes by synthesizing key insights and articulating the specific knowledge gaps this research fills.

### 2.2 The Concept of Leadership Readiness

#### 2.2.1 Leadership in the Digital Era

Leadership theory has evolved over the past century. Early trait theories focused on identifying inherent characteristics of effective leaders (Stogdill, 1948). Behavioral theories shifted attention to leadership actions rather than attributes (Blake & Mouton, 1964). Contingency theories recognized that effective leadership depends on situational factors (Fiedler, 1967). Transformational leadership theory emphasized leaders' ability to inspire change and develop followers (Bass, 1985).

The digital era introduces new demands on leadership. Digital transformation requires leaders to navigate technological change, manage virtual teams, and operate in ambiguous environments (Zeike et al., 2019). Traditional leadership competencies remain relevant but prove insufficient for digital contexts (Schwarzmüller et al., 2018).

Researchers have proposed various digital leadership concepts. Some scholars emphasize technological literacy as a core requirement (Westerman et al., 2014). Others focus on adaptive capabilities and continuous learning (Kane et al., 2019). Still others highlight the importance of network leadership and ecosystem thinking (Schrage, 2016).

Digital leadership differs from traditional leadership in several ways. Digital leaders must process information more rapidly, make decisions with greater uncertainty, and adapt to continuous technological change (Larjovuori et al., 2016). They operate in more transparent environments where information flows freely across organizational boundaries (Cortellazzo et al., 2019). Digital leaders also face new ethical challenges related to data privacy, algorithmic bias, and technological unemployment (Mittelstadt et al., 2016).

#### 2.2.2 Readiness as a Concept

Readiness refers to a state of preparedness for undertaking a specific activity or change (Weiner, 2009). Organizational readiness for change has received extensive attention in management literature. Researchers define organizational readiness as the extent to which organizational members are prepared to implement change (Armenakis et al., 1993).

Individual readiness operates at a different level of analysis. Individual readiness for change reflects a person's beliefs, attitudes, and intentions regarding a specific change initiative (Holt et al., 2007). Research shows that individual readiness influences change outcomes through its effects on change-supporting behaviors (Rafferty et al., 2013).

Leadership readiness extends the readiness concept to leadership contexts. Avolio (2005) describes leadership readiness as the capacity to engage in leadership roles. This capacity includes cognitive abilities, emotional maturity, social skills, and contextual understanding. Leadership readiness develops through experience, training, and reflection (Day et al., 2014).

Technology readiness represents another related concept. Parasuraman (2000) defines technology readiness as people's propensity to embrace and use new technologies. Technology readiness comprises four dimensions: optimism, innovativeness, discomfort, and insecurity. Later research extends this concept to organizational contexts (Parasuraman & Colby, 2015).

Leadership readiness for technological change combines these concepts. Leaders must possess both general leadership capabilities and technology-specific competencies (Guzmán et al., 2020). They need technical understanding without becoming technical experts. They must manage change while maintaining operational stability. They must balance innovation with risk management (Seo et al., 2012).

#### 2.2.3 Dimensions of Leadership Readiness

Researchers have identified various dimensions of leadership readiness for digital transformation. Schwarzmüller et al. (2018) propose six digital leadership competencies: digital literacy, digital vision, networking, change leadership, digital communication, and digital personal development. Their research in German companies shows that these competencies relate to digital transformation success.

Zeike et al. (2019) identify four digital leadership dimensions: digital competence (understanding technology), leadership competence (managing people), change competence (facilitating transformation), and strategic competence (creating vision). Their study of German healthcare leaders reveals that these dimensions predict transformation outcomes.

Other researchers emphasize different aspects. Cortellazzo et al. (2019) highlight cognitive flexibility, creativity, and social intelligence as key digital leadership competencies. Klein (2020) stresses the importance of data literacy, platform thinking, and digital ethics. Tumbas et al. (2017) focus on ambidexterity—the ability to balance exploitation and exploration.

These various frameworks share common themes. Most include technological understanding as a foundational element. Most recognize change management as critical. Most acknowledge the importance of continuous learning. Most address ethical and social dimensions. However, these frameworks derive from Western contexts and may not fully capture requirements in Asian settings.

### 2.3 Artificial Intelligence Transformation in Organizations

#### 2.3.1 Nature and Scope of AI Transformation

Artificial intelligence refers to computer systems that perform tasks requiring human intelligence (Russell & Norvig, 2020). These tasks include learning from experience, recognizing patterns, understanding language, and making decisions. AI technologies encompass machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2017).

AI transformation differs from other digital initiatives in scope and impact. While earlier digital transformations focused on connectivity and data, AI transformation centers on intelligence and automation (Fountaine et al., 2019). AI systems not only process information but learn from it and make autonomous decisions. This capability alters organizational processes, structures, and cultures (Brock & von Wangenheim, 2019).

Organizations pursue AI transformation for multiple reasons. Operational efficiency drives many initiatives as AI automates routine tasks and optimizes processes (Davenport & Ronanki, 2018). Customer experience enhancement motivates AI adoption in service industries through personalization and improved interactions (Huang & Rust, 2018). Strategic differentiation leads companies to develop AI-based products and services (Agrawal et al., 2018).

However, AI transformation presents substantial challenges. Technical challenges include data quality issues, integration complexities, and talent shortages (Ransbotham et al., 2020). Organizational challenges encompass resistance to change, skill gaps, and cultural barriers (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021). Strategic challenges involve unclear value propositions, unrealistic expectations, and inadequate governance (Fountaine et al., 2019).

#### 2.3.2 Leadership in AI Transformation

Research recognizes leadership's critical role in AI success. Mikalef and Gupta (2021) demonstrate that leadership capability influences AI-enabled transformation. Their study shows that leaders shape AI initiatives through vision creation, resource allocation, and cultural change facilitation.

Leaders face specific challenges in AI contexts. They must make decisions about technologies they may not fully understand (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2017). They must balance innovation with risk, particularly regarding data privacy and algorithmic fairness (Mittelstadt et al., 2016). They must manage workforce transitions as AI automates tasks and creates new roles (Huang et al., 2019).

Dwivedi et al. (2021) identify five leadership imperatives for AI success: developing AI vision and strategy, building AI-capable organizations, managing AI ethics and governance, fostering AI-enabled innovation, and ensuring continuous AI learning. These imperatives require distinct leadership competencies beyond traditional management skills.

Fountaine et al. (2019) describe three critical leadership activities in AI transformation: reimagining business processes through AI capabilities, designing organizational architectures that support AI initiatives, and developing workforce capabilities for the AI era. Leaders who execute these activities achieve better AI outcomes than those who focus on technology deployment.

Davenport and Ronanki (2018) emphasize the importance of starting small with AI initiatives. Leaders should pursue pilot projects that deliver quick wins and build organizational confidence. Success in early projects provides learning opportunities and generates momentum for broader transformation. This staged approach requires patience and long-term commitment from leaders.

#### 2.3.3 AI Adoption in Asian Contexts

Asia demonstrates rapid AI adoption but faces unique challenges. China leads in AI investment and deployment, particularly in facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities (Lee, 2018). Singapore focuses on AI for public services and smart nation initiatives (Tan et al., 2019). South Korea emphasizes AI in manufacturing and robotics (Kim et al., 2020).

Japan possesses strong technological capabilities and government support for AI development. The Japanese government has designated AI as a strategic priority for maintaining economic competitiveness (METI, 2020). Japanese companies invest in robotics and manufacturing AI applications (Yamamoto & Yamaguchi, 2020). However, Japan faces challenges including aging workforce, risk-averse corporate culture, and rigid organizational structures (Peltokorpi & Hasu, 2016).

Vietnam shows increasing AI interest despite earlier developmental stages. The Vietnamese government launched an AI strategy aimed at making Vietnam a regional AI hub (Ministry of Science and Technology, 2021). Vietnamese startups demonstrate growing AI innovation in fintech, e-commerce, and agriculture (Nguyen et al., 2021). However, Vietnam confronts challenges including limited AI talent, infrastructure gaps, and nascent regulatory frameworks (World Bank, 2022).

Cultural factors influence AI adoption patterns in Asia. High power distance affects how organizations implement AI, with less participatory approaches in hierarchical cultures (Li, 2022). Collectivism shapes concerns about AI's social impact, with greater emphasis on community effects versus individual rights (Chatterjee et al., 2021). Long-term orientation supports patient investment in AI capabilities but may slow rapid experimentation (Hofstede, 2001).

### 2.4 Cross-Cultural Leadership in Japanese and Vietnamese Contexts

#### 2.4.1 Cultural Dimensions Framework

Hofstede's (1980) cultural dimensions provide a foundational framework for understanding national culture differences. His research identifies six dimensions: power distance, individualism-collectivism, masculinity-femininity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and indulgence-restraint. These dimensions influence organizational behavior, management practices, and leadership styles across cultures.

Japan scores high on uncertainty avoidance (92), high on masculinity (95), moderate on power distance (54), low on individualism (46), high on long-term orientation (88), and low on indulgence (42) (Hofstede Insights, 2021). This profile suggests Japanese culture values stability, achievement, hierarchy, group harmony, future planning, and self-restraint.

Vietnam scores moderate on power distance (70), low on individualism (20), moderate on masculinity (40), moderate on uncertainty avoidance (30), high on long-term orientation (57), and moderate on indulgence (35) (Hofstede Insights, 2021). Vietnamese culture emphasizes hierarchy, collective welfare, balanced achievement approaches, adaptability, future orientation, and moderate restraint.

The GLOBE study (House et al., 2004) provides additional cultural insights. This research identifies nine cultural dimensions and examines leadership expectations across cultures. The study shows that effective leadership characteristics vary across cultural clusters. Asian cultures value humane-oriented, team-oriented, and participative leadership more than Western cultures.

#### 2.4.2 Japanese Leadership and Organizational Culture

Japanese leadership reflects distinctive cultural values. Traditional Japanese companies operate through ringi seido (consensus decision-making), nemawashi (informal consultation), and kaizen (continuous improvement) (Peltokorpi & Hasu, 2016). These practices create stable, harmonious organizations but may slow response to rapid change.

Japanese leaders emphasize group harmony over individual achievement. They build consensus through careful consultation and avoid direct confrontation (Misumi & Peterson, 1985). Senior leaders often serve as facilitators rather than directive authorities. This approach maintains social cohesion but can delay decisive action in crisis situations.

Loyalty and long-term employment characterize traditional Japanese organizations. Lifetime employment systems create strong organizational commitment but may reduce flexibility (Aoki, 2010). Recent economic pressures have weakened these systems, creating generational tensions and identity concerns (Peltokorpi & Hasu, 2016).

Japanese organizations show high context communication patterns. Information flows through informal networks, and explicit statement of conflict remains rare (Hall, 1976). This style supports harmony but can create ambiguity and slow information sharing. Foreign partners often find Japanese communication indirect and difficult to interpret.

Seniority remains important in Japanese organizations despite growing performance emphasis. Age and tenure influence decision-making authority more than in Western firms (Taka & Foglia, 1994). This creates challenges when younger employees possess greater digital skills than senior leaders. The tension between traditional hierarchy and digital expertise creates adaptation difficulties.

#### 2.4.3 Vietnamese Leadership and Organizational Culture

Vietnamese leadership combines traditional Confucian values with socialist influences and emerging market dynamism. Confucian heritage emphasizes respect for hierarchy, education value, and family-like organizational relationships (Nguyen & Aoyama, 2014). Socialist period introduced state control and collective orientation. Recent market reforms encourage entrepreneurship and pragmatism (Truong & Rowley, 2021).

Vietnamese leaders balance respect for authority with participative aspirations. Power distance remains significant, with clear hierarchical structures (Hofstede Insights, 2021). However, younger Vietnamese leaders show more participative tendencies than older generations (Nguyen et al., 2020). This generational shift creates varying leadership styles across organizations.

Vietnamese organizations demonstrate strong collectivist orientation. Group welfare takes precedence over individual interests (Ralston et al., 1999). Family and personal relationships influence business decisions. Trust develops through relationship building rather than formal contracts (Nguyen & Aoyama, 2014).

Vietnamese business culture shows high adaptability and pragmatism. Economic reforms required rapid adjustment to market mechanisms (Gainsborough, 2010). This experience created organizational flexibility and willingness to experiment. Vietnamese companies often adopt new practices more quickly than established Asian economies (Truong & Rowley, 2021).

The Vietnamese workforce demonstrates strong learning orientation and educational aspiration. High literacy rates and education value support skill development (World Bank, 2022). However, practical application gaps exist between educational credentials and workplace capabilities (Bodewig et al., 2019). This creates challenges in developing advanced technological competencies.

### 2.5 Research Gaps and Framework Development

#### 2.5.1 Identified Gaps in Literature

The literature review reveals several important gaps. First, existing research on digital leadership focuses on Western contexts. Studies examine European and North American organizations but rarely address Asian settings systematically (Li, 2022). This geographic bias limits understanding of how cultural factors shape digital leadership requirements.

Second, most digital leadership research addresses general digital transformation rather than AI specifically. While AI represents a subset of digital initiatives, it presents unique challenges related to algorithmic decision-making, autonomous systems, and ethical concerns (Dwivedi et al., 2021). Leadership requirements for AI transformation may differ from broader digital change.

Third, existing frameworks do not integrate cultural dimensions with technological competencies. Current models develop in single-country contexts and lack cross-cultural validation (Schwarzmüller et al., 2018). Understanding how cultural values interact with leadership readiness dimensions remains underdeveloped.

Fourth, limited research compares AI leadership readiness across Asian countries. While some studies examine AI adoption in individual Asian nations, comparative research remains rare (Li, 2022). Such comparisons could illuminate how different cultural contexts require different leadership approaches to AI transformation.

Fifth, measurement instruments for leadership readiness in AI contexts require further development. Existing scales address general digital competencies or technology readiness but not AI-specific leadership requirements (Parasuraman & Colby, 2015). Validated instruments would enable systematic assessment and research advancement.

#### 2.5.2 Theoretical Foundation for the Study

This research draws on three theoretical perspectives. First, competency-based leadership theory provides the foundation for identifying specific capabilities leaders need (Boyatzis, 2008). This perspective suggests that leadership effectiveness depends on demonstrable competencies rather than abstract traits. Competencies can be assessed, developed, and validated empirically.

Second, organizational readiness for change theory guides understanding of how individual readiness aggregates to organizational outcomes (Weiner, 2009). This theory suggests that change success depends on collective readiness, which stems from individual members' beliefs, attitudes, and capabilities. Leadership readiness represents a critical component of organizational readiness.

Third, cultural contingency theory informs expectations about how cultural context shapes leadership requirements (House et al., 2004). This perspective suggests that effective leadership practices vary across cultures. What constitutes ready leadership in one cultural context may differ in another. Understanding these variations requires explicit cultural comparison.

The research integrates these theoretical perspectives to develop a culturally informed competency framework for AI leadership readiness. This integration addresses the identified gaps by examining AI-specific competencies across culturally distinct Asian contexts.

### 2.6 Summary

This chapter reviewed literature on leadership readiness, AI transformation, and cross-cultural management. The review established that leadership plays a critical role in AI transformation success but that existing research provides limited guidance for Asian contexts. Japanese and Vietnamese organizational cultures differ in important ways that influence leadership readiness requirements.

The literature reveals four primary dimensions relevant to AI leadership readiness: technological competence, change management capability, ethical awareness, and adaptive learning orientation. However, these dimensions require empirical validation and cultural contextualization. The identified gaps justify the current research and guide the development of research questions and methodology described in Chapter 3.

## Chapter 3: Research Methodology

### 3.1 Introduction

This chapter describes the research methodology employed to develop and validate the Leadership Readiness for AI Transformation (LRAIT) framework. The study uses a sequential mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative phases. The research proceeds through four stages: literature review and preliminary framework development, qualitative exploration through interviews, quantitative survey development and validation, and comparative analysis between Japan and Vietnam.

This chapter explains the operational definitions of key concepts, presents the conceptual framework, states research objectives and hypotheses, describes data collection procedures, and outlines analysis methods. The methodology follows established practices for scale development and cross-cultural research (Churchill, 1979; Brislin, 1970).

### 3.2 Operational Definitions

#### 3.2.1 Leadership Readiness for AI Transformation

Leadership readiness for AI transformation refers to the extent to which leaders possess the competencies, attitudes, and capabilities required to guide organizations through artificial intelligence adoption and implementation. This readiness encompasses both technical and non-technical dimensions that enable leaders to create vision, manage change, address ethical concerns, and foster learning in AI contexts.

#### 3.2.2 Technological Competence

Technological competence represents leaders' understanding of AI technologies, including their capabilities, limitations, and organizational applications. This competence does not require deep technical expertise but encompasses sufficient knowledge to make informed decisions, communicate with technical teams, and identify appropriate use cases for AI implementation.

#### 3.2.3 Change Management Capability

Change management capability reflects leaders' skills in planning, implementing, and sustaining organizational change associated with AI adoption. This capability includes stakeholder engagement, communication effectiveness, resistance management, and creating organizational structures that support AI initiatives.

#### 3.2.4 Ethical Awareness

Ethical awareness represents leaders' understanding of ethical issues arising from AI adoption, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, transparency, and social impact. This awareness encompasses both knowledge of ethical principles and ability to integrate ethical considerations into AI decision-making and governance.

#### 3.2.5 Adaptive Learning Orientation

Adaptive learning orientation reflects leaders' willingness and ability to engage in continuous learning about AI technologies, implementation practices, and organizational impacts. This orientation includes openness to new information, ability to learn from failures, and commitment to ongoing capability development.

#### 3.2.6 AI Transformation Success

AI transformation success refers to the extent to which AI initiatives achieve intended objectives, including operational improvements, strategic advantages, and organizational capability development. Success encompasses both tangible outcomes (cost savings, revenue growth) and intangible benefits (learning, culture change).

### 3.3 Conceptual Framework

The research develops a conceptual framework based on literature review and preliminary qualitative research. The framework proposes that leadership readiness for AI transformation comprises four primary dimensions: technological competence, change management capability, ethical awareness, and adaptive learning orientation. These dimensions influence AI transformation success while being shaped by cultural context.

The framework incorporates cultural dimensions as moderating factors that influence the relationship between readiness dimensions and outcomes. Specifically, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, and long-term orientation moderate how leadership readiness translates into transformation success.

**Figure 3.1: Conceptual Framework**

```
Cultural Context
(Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance, 
Collectivism, Long-term Orientation)
                ↓ (moderates)
                
Leadership Readiness → AI Transformation Success
Dimensions:              Outcomes:
- Technological         - Operational Outcomes
  Competence           - Strategic Outcomes
- Change Management    - Organizational Learning
  Capability
- Ethical Awareness
- Adaptive Learning
  Orientation
```

The framework suggests several relationships. First, each readiness dimension positively influences transformation success. Leaders with higher technological competence, stronger change management capability, greater ethical awareness, and stronger adaptive learning orientation achieve better AI outcomes.

Second, readiness dimensions interact with each other. Technological competence enables more effective change management. Ethical awareness shapes how leaders apply technological understanding. Adaptive learning orientation supports continuous development of all other dimensions.

Third, cultural context moderates these relationships. High power distance may strengthen the importance of senior leader readiness while reducing the impact of mid-level leader capabilities. High uncertainty avoidance may increase the importance of change management capability. Collectivism may enhance the value of ethical awareness. Long-term orientation may strengthen the impact of adaptive learning orientation.

### 3.4 Research Objectives

The study pursues four specific objectives:

**Objective 1:** Identify and validate the key dimensions of leadership readiness for AI transformation through literature synthesis and qualitative research.

**Objective 2:** Develop and psychometrically validate the Leadership Readiness for AI Transformation (LRAIT) measurement instrument applicable to Japanese and Vietnamese contexts.

**Objective 3:** Compare leadership readiness profiles between Japanese and Vietnamese leaders and examine how cultural factors explain observed differences.

**Objective 4:** Examine the relationship between leadership readiness dimensions and AI transformation outcomes in both countries.

### 3.5 Hypothesis Development

Based on the literature review and conceptual framework, the research tests several hypotheses:

**H1: Technological competence positively relates to AI transformation success.**

Leaders who understand AI capabilities and limitations make better decisions about AI investments and applications (Dwivedi et al., 2021). Higher technological competence enables more realistic expectations, better resource allocation, and more effective communication with technical teams. Research on digital transformation shows that leader digital literacy predicts implementation success (Schwarzmüller et al., 2018).

**H2: Change management capability positively relates to AI transformation success.**

AI transformation requires substantial organizational change including process redesign, skill development, and cultural adaptation (Fountaine et al., 2019). Leaders skilled in change management navigate these transitions more effectively. Change management research demonstrates strong relationships between change leadership competencies and transformation outcomes (Higgs & Rowland, 2011).

**H3: Ethical awareness positively relates to AI transformation success.**

Ethical issues create significant risks in AI implementation including reputation damage, regulatory penalties, and stakeholder backlash (Mittelstadt et al., 2016). Leaders who proactively address ethical concerns build trust and sustainable AI systems. Research shows that ethical leadership influences organizational innovation and sustainability (Brown & Treviño, 2006).

**H4: Adaptive learning orientation positively relates to AI transformation success.**

AI technologies evolve rapidly, requiring continuous learning and adaptation (Davenport & Ronanki, 2018). Leaders committed to ongoing learning maintain relevant knowledge and model learning behaviors for their organizations. Learning organization research demonstrates that leadership learning orientation influences organizational learning capability and performance (Vera & Crossan, 2004).

**H5: Japanese and Vietnamese leaders differ significantly in their leadership readiness profiles.**

Cultural differences between Japan and Vietnam suggest different leadership readiness patterns (Hofstede Insights, 2021). Japanese leaders may demonstrate higher technological competence given Japan's advanced technical capabilities and engineering culture (Peltokorpi & Hasu, 2016). Vietnamese leaders may show stronger adaptive learning orientation given Vietnam's rapid economic transformation experience (Truong & Rowley, 2021). These differences reflect cultural values, educational emphases, and organizational traditions.

**H6: Cultural dimensions moderate the relationship between leadership readiness and AI transformation success.**

Cultural context influences how leadership capabilities translate into outcomes (House et al., 2004). In high power distance cultures, senior leader readiness may matter more than in low power distance cultures. In high uncertainty avoidance cultures, structured change management may prove more critical. These moderating effects reflect how cultural values shape organizational change processes.

### 3.6 Research Design and Methods

#### 3.6.1 Research Philosophy and Approach

This research adopts a pragmatic philosophical stance. Pragmatism values practical problem-solving and recognizes that different research questions require different methods (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018). The research combines interpretive and positivist elements to address complex questions about leadership readiness across cultures.

The study uses a sequential exploratory mixed-methods design. Qualitative research in Phase 1 explores leadership readiness dimensions and informs instrument development. Quantitative research in Phase 2 tests the framework and examines relationships between variables. This sequence enables both theory development and theory testing (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2010).

All qualitative analyses employ QualCoder (version 3.3), an open-source qualitative data analysis software, ensuring systematic and transparent thematic analysis. All quantitative analyses use Python (version 3.9) with comprehensive statistical libraries, providing reproducible and rigorous statistical procedures. This software approach aligns with open science principles and enables full transparency of analytical methods.

#### 3.6.2 Research Phases

**Phase 1: Qualitative Exploration (Months 1-6)**

Phase 1 conducts semi-structured interviews with leaders in Japanese and Vietnamese organizations. This phase serves three purposes: validating readiness dimensions identified in literature, identifying culturally specific aspects of AI leadership readiness, and informing survey instrument development.

The interview protocol covers six topics: (1) leader's experience with AI initiatives, (2) perceived challenges in AI transformation, (3) competencies leaders believe they need for AI success, (4) differences between AI transformation and other change initiatives, (5) cultural factors influencing AI adoption, and (6) learning approaches for developing AI leadership capabilities.

**Phase 2: Instrument Development (Months 7-9)**

Phase 2 develops the LRAIT measurement instrument based on literature review and Phase 1 findings. The instrument development follows Churchill's (1979) scale development procedure: specify domain, generate item pool, conduct expert review, conduct pilot testing, and perform psychometric analysis.

Initial item generation creates 8-10 items for each dimension identified in Phase 1. Expert review with five academics and five practitioners evaluates content validity. Pilot testing with 50 leaders in each country assesses item clarity and preliminary psychometric properties. Psychometric analysis uses exploratory factor analysis to refine the instrument.

**Phase 3: Large-Scale Survey (Months 10-14)**

Phase 3 administers the refined LRAIT instrument to large samples of leaders in Japan and Vietnam. The survey also collects data on AI transformation outcomes, organizational characteristics, and demographic variables. Additional items assess cultural value orientations to enable moderation analysis.

**Phase 4: Comparative Analysis (Months 15-18)**

Phase 4 conducts comparative analyses between Japanese and Vietnamese samples. Analysis examines differences in leadership readiness profiles, validates the LRAIT instrument across both cultures, and tests hypotheses about relationships between readiness and outcomes. Moderation analysis examines how cultural dimensions influence these relationships.

### 3.7 Data Collection Framework

#### 3.7.1 Qualitative Data Collection

**Sample Selection**

The qualitative phase uses purposive sampling to select interview participants. Selection criteria include: (1) current role as mid-level or senior leader, (2) involvement in AI-related initiatives or decisions, (3) minimum three years leadership experience, and (4) willingness to participate in 60-90 minute interviews.

The study targets 20-25 interviews in each country for a total of 40-50 interviews. Sampling continues until theoretical saturation occurs—when new interviews provide no significant additional insights (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Participants represent diverse industries including manufacturing, financial services, retail, healthcare, and technology.

**Interview Procedures**

Interviews follow a semi-structured protocol allowing flexibility while ensuring consistent topic coverage. Interviews are conducted in participants' native languages (Japanese or Vietnamese) by researchers fluent in these languages. Interviews are recorded and transcribed verbatim with participant consent.

The interview begins with warm-up questions about the participant's background and organization. Core questions explore leadership experiences with AI, perceived readiness factors, and cultural influences. Probing questions follow up on interesting or unclear responses. The interview concludes with open-ended questions about additional relevant topics.

All interview data is managed using QualCoder software, which provides systematic organization of transcripts, coding structures, and analytical memos. This ensures consistent data management across the qualitative phase and facilitates rigorous thematic analysis.

**Qualitative Data Analysis**

Transcripts undergo thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke's (2006) procedure. Analysis begins with familiarization through repeated reading of transcripts. Initial coding identifies relevant text segments. Focused coding groups initial codes into potential themes. Theme review validates themes against data. Theme definition clarifies the essence of each theme.

The analysis uses QualCoder software (version 3.3) to manage coding and facilitate pattern identification. QualCoder, an open-source qualitative data analysis program written in Python, provides a comprehensive environment for organizing transcripts, developing code systems, writing analytical memos, and generating visual representations of thematic structures (Curtain, 2023). The software enables systematic coding while maintaining flexibility for emergent insights. 

Two researchers independently code 20% of transcripts to assess coding reliability. The inter-coder reliability is calculated using Cohen's Kappa:

**Formula 3.1: Cohen's Kappa**
```
κ = (Po - Pe) / (1 - Pe)

Where:
Po = Observed agreement proportion
Pe = Expected agreement by chance
κ = 1.0 indicates perfect agreement
κ = 0.0 indicates chance agreement
κ > 0.70 indicates acceptable reliability
```

Discrepancies are discussed and resolved through consensus. The analysis identifies both common themes across cultures and culturally specific patterns.

#### 3.7.2 Quantitative Data Collection

**Survey Sample**

The quantitative phase targets 400-500 respondents in each country for a total of 800-1000 responses. This sample size provides adequate power for planned analyses including factor analysis and structural equation modeling (Hair et al., 2017).

The required sample size for multiple regression is calculated using the formula:

**Formula 3.2: Required Sample Size for Multiple Regression**
```
N = 50 + 8k

Where:
N = Required sample size
k = Number of independent variables
8k = Rule of thumb for adequate power

For this study:
k = 9 (4 readiness dimensions + 5 control variables)
N = 50 + 8(9) = 50 + 72 = 122 minimum per country

Target with 20% buffer: 122 × 1.20 = 146 per country
Actual achieved: 213 (Japan) and 215 (Vietnam)
```

Sampling employs a multi-stage approach. First, organizations pursuing AI initiatives are identified through industry databases, news reports, and professional networks. Second, human resource or leadership development contacts within these organizations are approached to facilitate access. Third, invitations are sent to leaders meeting selection criteria.

Selection criteria for survey participants include: (1) current role as team leader, department head, or senior executive, (2) organization implementing AI initiatives, (3) minimum two years in current leadership role, and (4) willingness to complete a 25-30 minute survey.

**Survey Instrument**

The survey contains six sections:

1. **Demographic and Background Information:** Age, gender, education, tenure, position level, industry, company size

2. **Leadership Readiness for AI Transformation (LRAIT):** Items measuring four readiness dimensions

3. **AI Transformation Outcomes:** Items assessing implementation success, operational impact, strategic impact, and organizational learning

4. **Cultural Value Orientation:** Items measuring power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism-collectivism, and long-term orientation

5. **Organizational Context:** Items measuring organizational support for AI, resource availability, and technical infrastructure

6. **Open-Ended Questions:** Two questions soliciting additional insights on AI leadership challenges and success factors

The core LRAIT scale contains 32 items (8 per dimension) using 7-point Likert scales from "Strongly Disagree" (1) to "Strongly Agree" (7). Higher scores indicate greater readiness on each dimension.

**Translation and Cultural Adaptation**

Survey translation follows Brislin's (1970) back-translation procedure. Original English items are translated into Japanese and Vietnamese by professional translators familiar with business contexts. Back-translation into English by independent translators checks equivalence. Discrepancies are resolved through discussion among translators and researchers.

Cultural adaptation goes beyond literal translation. Items are reviewed for cultural appropriateness and modified when necessary to fit local contexts. For example, examples used in items are changed to reflect relevant local cases. Pilot testing further identifies and resolves cultural adaptation issues.

**Data Collection Procedures**

Survey distribution uses multiple channels to maximize response rates. Online surveys are distributed through organizational contacts, professional associations, and social media platforms. Paper surveys are provided when requested. Follow-up reminders are sent at two-week intervals.

To encourage participation, the research offers several incentives: summary reports of findings, personalized feedback on leadership readiness scores (optional), and entry into a drawing for gift cards. Institutional endorsements from universities and professional associations lend credibility to the research.

### 3.8 Data Analysis

#### 3.8.1 Qualitative Analysis

Thematic analysis identifies key dimensions of leadership readiness and cultural influences on AI transformation. Analysis occurs at multiple levels: manifest (explicit statements) and latent (underlying meanings). Within-culture analysis identifies patterns in each country separately. Cross-culture analysis compares themes between Japan and Vietnam.

The analysis employs constant comparison to identify similarities and differences (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Direct quotes illustrate themes and provide evidence for interpretations. Negative cases—instances that don't fit identified patterns—are examined to refine understanding.

Trustworthiness is enhanced through several strategies (Lincoln & Guba, 1985): prolonged engagement with data, peer debriefing with colleagues, member checking with selected participants, and maintaining an audit trail of analytical decisions.

Qualitative data analysis utilizes QualCoder (version 3.3), an open-source qualitative analysis software, for coding and theme management. QualCoder provides comprehensive tools for transcript management, coding, memo-writing, and visualization of thematic patterns. Python (version 3.9) is employed for supplementary text analysis and advanced visualization of qualitative findings.

#### 3.8.2 Quantitative Analysis

**Statistical Software and Tools**

All quantitative analyses were conducted using Python (version 3.9) with the following libraries: pandas (version 1.3.0) for data manipulation, NumPy (version 1.21.0) for numerical computations, SciPy (version 1.7.0) for statistical tests, statsmodels (version 0.12.2) for regression analysis, scikit-learn (version 0.24.2) for additional statistical procedures, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. Factor analyses were conducted using the factor_analyzer library (version 0.4.0), while structural equation modeling employed the semopy library (version 2.3.0). This Python-based approach provided transparent, reproducible analyses with full control over statistical procedures.

**Preliminary Analysis**

Data screening examines missing values, outliers, and normality using pandas and NumPy functions. Missing value patterns are analyzed to determine if they are missing completely at random (MCAR) using Little's MCAR test implemented in Python. Multiple imputation is performed using the IterativeImputer from scikit-learn if missing values exceed 5% but show MCAR patterns (Schafer & Graham, 2002). 

Outliers are identified through box plots generated with Matplotlib and standardized scores calculated using SciPy. The standardized score (z-score) formula:

**Formula 3.3: Z-Score for Outlier Detection**
```
z = (X - μ) / σ

Where:
X = Individual observation
μ = Sample mean
σ = Sample standard deviation
|z| > 3.0 = Potential outlier
|z| > 3.5 = Extreme outlier requiring removal
```

Multivariate outliers are assessed using Mahalanobis distance computed through NumPy linear algebra functions:

**Formula 3.4: Mahalanobis Distance**
```
D² = (x - μ)ᵀ Σ⁻¹ (x - μ)

Where:
D² = Mahalanobis distance squared
x = Vector of observations for a case
μ = Vector of means
Σ⁻¹ = Inverse covariance matrix
ᵀ = Transpose operator

Critical value from χ² distribution with p degrees of freedom
(p = number of variables) at α = .001
```

Extreme outliers are removed if they represent data entry errors or invalid responses.

Descriptive statistics are computed using pandas describe() and groupby() methods to summarize demographic characteristics, mean scores on study variables, and preliminary correlations. Independent samples t-tests are conducted using SciPy's stats.ttest_ind() function to compare Japanese and Vietnamese samples:

**Formula 3.5: Independent Samples t-test**
```
t = (M₁ - M₂) / √(s²p(1/n₁ + 1/n₂))

Where:
M₁, M₂ = Sample means
n₁, n₂ = Sample sizes
s²p = Pooled variance = ((n₁-1)s²₁ + (n₂-1)s²₂) / (n₁+n₂-2)
df = n₁ + n₂ - 2

Effect size (Cohen's d):
d = (M₁ - M₂) / sp
where sp = √s²p
```

**Psychometric Validation**

The LRAIT instrument undergoes rigorous psychometric validation using Python statistical libraries. Reliability is assessed through Cronbach's alpha:

**Formula 3.6: Cronbach's Alpha**
```
α = (k / (k-1)) × (1 - (Σσ²ᵢ / σ²ₜ))

Where:
k = Number of items
σ²ᵢ = Variance of item i
σ²ₜ = Variance of total scale score
Σσ²ᵢ = Sum of all item variances

Interpretation:
α ≥ 0.90 = Excellent
α ≥ 0.80 = Good
α ≥ 0.70 = Acceptable
α < 0.70 = Questionable
```

Composite reliability is calculated from confirmatory factor analysis results:

**Formula 3.7: Composite Reliability (CR)**
```
CR = (Σλᵢ)² / ((Σλᵢ)² + Σδᵢ)

Where:
λᵢ = Standardized factor loading for item i
δᵢ = Error variance for item i (δᵢ = 1 - λᵢ²)
Σ = Sum across all items in the construct

CR > 0.70 indicates acceptable reliability
CR > 0.80 indicates good reliability
```

Validity testing includes several types. Content validity is established through expert review in Phase 2. Construct validity is assessed through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using the factor_analyzer library. Model fit is evaluated using multiple indices computed from the CFA results:

**Formula 3.8: CFA Fit Indices**
```
CFI = (χ²null - dfnull) - (χ²model - dfmodel) / (χ²null - dfnull)
where CFI > 0.90 = acceptable fit

TLI = ((χ²null/dfnull) - (χ²model/dfmodel)) / ((χ²null/dfnull) - 1)
where TLI > 0.90 = acceptable fit

RMSEA = √((χ²model - dfmodel) / (dfmodel × N))
where RMSEA < 0.08 = acceptable fit
      RMSEA < 0.05 = good fit

SRMR = √(Σ(sᵢⱼ - σ̂ᵢⱼ)² / p(p+1)/2)
where SRMR < 0.08 = acceptable fit
      sᵢⱼ = observed correlation
      σ̂ᵢⱼ = predicted correlation
      p = number of variables
```

Convergent validity is demonstrated when items load strongly on their intended factors (loadings > .70) and average variance extracted (AVE) exceeds .50:

**Formula 3.9: Average Variance Extracted (AVE)**
```
AVE = Σλᵢ² / k

Where:
λᵢ² = Squared standardized factor loading
k = Number of items

AVE > 0.50 indicates convergent validity
This means >50% of variance is captured by the construct
```

Discriminant validity is shown when the square root of AVE for each construct exceeds its correlations with other constructs:

**Formula 3.10: Discriminant Validity (Fornell-Larcker Criterion)**
```
√AVEᵢ > rᵢⱼ for all i ≠ j

Where:
√AVEᵢ = Square root of AVE for construct i
rᵢⱼ = Correlation between constructs i and j

This ensures each construct shares more variance with
its own indicators than with other constructs
```

Measurement invariance across Japan and Vietnam is tested through multi-group CFA implemented in Python. Invariance testing proceeds sequentially: configural invariance (same factor structure), metric invariance (equal factor loadings), scalar invariance (equal item intercepts), and residual invariance (equal error variances) (Vandenberg & Lance, 2000). 

**Formula 3.11: Measurement Invariance Testing**
```
Δχ² test between nested models:

Δχ² = χ²constrained - χ²unconstrained
Δdf = dfconstrained - dfunconstrained

Alternative: ΔCFI test (less sensitive to sample size)
ΔCFI = CFIconstrained - CFIunconstrained

Invariance established when:
- Δχ² non-significant at α = .05, OR
- ΔCFI < 0.010 (Cheung & Rensvold, 2002)

Partial invariance acceptable when ≥2 items per
construct show invariance (Byrne et al., 1989)
```

Establishing at least partial scalar invariance enables meaningful mean comparisons between countries.

**Hypothesis Testing**

H1-H4 (relationships between readiness dimensions and outcomes) are tested using multiple regression analysis implemented through statsmodels OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression:

**Formula 3.12: Multiple Regression Model**
```
Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + β₃X₃ + β₄X₄ + ε

Where:
Y = AI transformation success
X₁ = Technological competence
X₂ = Change management capability
X₃ = Ethical awareness
X₄ = Adaptive learning orientation
β₀ = Intercept
β₁, β₂, β₃, β₄ = Regression coefficients
ε = Error term

R² = Explained variance / Total variance
Adjusted R² = 1 - ((1-R²)(N-1) / (N-k-1))
where N = sample size, k = number of predictors
```

Hierarchical regression enters control variables in Step 1 and readiness dimensions in Step 2:

**Formula 3.13: Hierarchical Regression R² Change**
```
ΔR² = R²full - R²controls

F-test for R² change:
F = (ΔR² / k) / ((1-R²full) / (N-k-1))

Where:
k = Number of added predictors
N = Sample size
df₁ = k
df₂ = N-k-1

Standardized coefficient (beta weight):
β = b(SDx / SDy)
where b = unstandardized coefficient
      SDx = standard deviation of predictor
      SDy = standard deviation of outcome
```

H5 (differences between countries) is tested through multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) implemented using statsmodels:

**Formula 3.14: MANOVA**
```
Wilks' Lambda (Λ):
Λ = |E| / |H + E|

Where:
|E| = Determinant of error SSCP matrix
|H| = Determinant of hypothesis SSCP matrix

F-approximation of Wilks' Lambda:
F = ((1-Λ) / Λ) × ((N-k-1) / k)

Where:
N = Total sample size
k = Number of dependent variables

Partial η²= 1 - Λ (effect size measure)
η² = 0.01 (small), 0.06 (medium), 0.14 (large)
```

Significant MANOVA results are followed by univariate ANOVAs using SciPy's f_oneway() function:

**Formula 3.15: One-Way ANOVA**
```
F = MSbetween / MSwithin

Where:
MSbetween = SSbetween / dfbetween
MSwithin = SSwithin / dfwithin

SSbetween = Σnᵢ(Mᵢ - Mgrand)²
SSwithin = ΣΣ(Xᵢⱼ - Mᵢ)²

dfbetween = k - 1 (k = number of groups)
dfwithin = N - k (N = total sample size)
```

H6 (cultural moderation) is tested through moderated regression analysis:

**Formula 3.16: Moderated Regression**
```
Y = β₀ + β₁X + β₂M + β₃(X×M) + ε

Where:
Y = Outcome variable
X = Predictor (readiness dimension)
M = Moderator (cultural value)
X×M = Interaction term
β₃ = Moderation effect

Significant β₃ indicates moderation

Simple slopes at ±1 SD of moderator:
Slope at high M = β₁ + β₃(M+1SD)
Slope at low M = β₁ + β₃(M-1SD)

Test significance of simple slopes:
t = slope / SE(slope)
```

Significant interactions indicate moderation effects. Simple slopes analysis interprets significant interactions by plotting relationships at high and low levels of moderators (Aiken & West, 1991).

Structural equation modeling (SEM) tests the overall conceptual framework using the semopy library. SEM simultaneously estimates measurement models (relationships between indicators and constructs) and structural models (relationships among constructs):

**Formula 3.17: Structural Equation Model**
```
Measurement Model:
X = Λₓξ + δ (exogenous indicators)
Y = Λᵧη + ε (endogenous indicators)

Structural Model:
η = Βη + Γξ + ζ

Where:
X, Y = Observed indicators
ξ = Exogenous latent variables
η = Endogenous latent variables
Λₓ, Λᵧ = Factor loading matrices
Β = Structural coefficients (endogenous effects)
Γ = Structural coefficients (exogenous effects)
δ, ε = Measurement errors
ζ = Structural disturbances

Chi-square test:
χ² = (N-1) × Fₘₗ
where Fₘₗ = Maximum likelihood fit function
```

Multi-group SEM compares path coefficients between Japanese and Vietnamese samples. Model fit indices are computed and evaluated against established thresholds.

**Dominance Analysis**

Relative importance of predictors is assessed using dominance analysis:

**Formula 3.18: Dominance Analysis**
```
General Dominance Weight for predictor i:
Dᵢ = Σ(R²ₛ₊ᵢ - R²ₛ) / C(k-1, |S|)

Where:
R²ₛ₊ᵢ = R² for model with subset S and predictor i
R²ₛ = R² for model with only subset S
C(k-1, |S|) = Number of subsets of size |S|
k = Total number of predictors
|S| = Size of subset S

Relative Importance (%):
%Importanceᵢ = Dᵢ / R²full × 100

Complete dominance: Predictor i dominates j if
C(i,j|S) > 0 for all subsets S not containing i or j
where C(i,j|S) = (R²ₛ₊ᵢ - R²ₛ) - (R²ₛ₊ⱼ - R²ₛ)
```

**Data Visualization**

All statistical results are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. Visualizations include distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, regression diagnostic plots, interaction plots for moderation effects, and path diagrams for structural equation models. Figures are generated programmatically to ensure reproducibility and consistency.

## Chapter 4: Findings

### 4.1 Introduction

This chapter presents findings from the study of leadership readiness for AI transformation in Japanese and Vietnamese organizations. The chapter organizes results according to the four research objectives. Section 4.2 reports qualitative findings identifying leadership readiness dimensions. Section 4.3 presents psychometric validation of the LRAIT instrument. Section 4.4 compares leadership readiness profiles between Japan and Vietnam. Section 4.5 examines relationships between readiness dimensions and AI transformation outcomes. Section 4.6 provides a comprehensive summary of findings.

Qualitative data was analyzed using QualCoder software for systematic thematic analysis, while quantitative data was analyzed using Python statistical libraries for rigorous hypothesis testing and model validation. All analytical procedures followed the methodology detailed in Chapter 3.

### 4.2 Research Objective 1: Identifying Leadership Readiness Dimensions

#### Sample Characteristics

The qualitative phase conducted 45 interviews: 23 in Japan and 22 in Vietnam. Table 4.1 summarizes participant characteristics.

**Table 4.1: Qualitative Sample Characteristics**

| Characteristic | Japan (n=23) | Vietnam (n=22) | Total (n=45) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Average Age (years) | 47.0 | 39.9 | 43.5 |
| Gender (% Male) | 78% | 55% | 67% |
| Senior Leader (%) | 52% | 41% | 47% |
| Mid-level Leader (%) | 48% | 59% | 53% |
| **Industries** | | | |
| Financial Services | 8 | 4 | 12 |
| Healthcare | 6 | 1 | 7 |
| Manufacturing | 6 | 3 | 9 |
| Retail | 2 | 4 | 6 |
| Technology | 0 | 5 | 5 |
| Other | 1 | 5 | 6 |
| Average AI Experience (years) | 3.6 | 3.3 | 3.5 |
| Average Interview Duration (minutes) | 78 | 68 | 73 |

The Japanese sample averaged 47.0 years of age, with male leaders representing 78% of participants. Senior leaders comprised 52% of the Japanese sample. Financial services (n=8), healthcare (n=6), and manufacturing (n=6) dominated industry representation. Japanese participants averaged 3.6 years of AI experience, with interviews lasting an average of 78 minutes.

The Vietnamese sample averaged 39.9 years of age, significantly younger than the Japanese cohort by 7.1 years. Male leaders represented 55% of Vietnamese participants, showing greater gender balance compared to Japan. Mid-level leaders comprised 59% of the Vietnamese sample. Technology (n=5), retail (n=4), and financial services (n=4) showed the strongest representation. Vietnamese participants averaged 3.3 years of AI experience, with interviews averaging 68 minutes.

The age difference between samples reflects broader demographic patterns in Japanese and Vietnamese business leadership. Japan's more established economy supports longer leadership career paths, while Vietnam's rapid growth creates earlier leadership opportunities. The gender distribution difference suggests Vietnam's emerging economy may offer more diverse leadership pathways. Japanese organizations show more traditional gender representation in leadership positions.

Industry distribution differences align with economic structures. Japan's strong representation in traditional sectors (financial services, healthcare, manufacturing) reflects its mature economy and established industrial base. Vietnam's stronger technology sector presence (n=5 versus n=0 in Japan) indicates its digital economy focus and the role of technology startups in driving AI adoption. The "Other" category in Vietnam (n=5) includes emerging industries like e-commerce platforms and digital services that are less prominent in Japan's more traditional business landscape.

AI experience averaged 3.5 years across both samples, indicating that participants had substantial exposure to AI initiatives without being early pioneers. This experience level provided informed perspectives on leadership readiness requirements. The 10-minute difference in average interview duration (78 minutes for Japan versus 68 minutes for Vietnam) may reflect cultural communication styles, with Japanese participants providing more detailed contextual explanations.

Inter-coder reliability reached acceptable levels for both samples. Cohen's Kappa for the Japanese transcripts was κ=0.82, and for Vietnamese transcripts κ=0.79, both exceeding the 0.70 threshold for acceptable reliability. These values were calculated as:

```
Japan: κ = (0.89 - 0.30) / (1 - 0.30) = 0.82
Vietnam: κ = (0.86 - 0.28) / (1 - 0.28) = 0.79

Where Po (observed agreement) was 0.89 and 0.86 respectively
And Pe (expected agreement) was 0.30 and 0.28 respectively
```

This strong inter-coder reliability supports the credibility of the qualitative findings.

#### Theme 1: Technological Understanding Enables Strategic Decision-Making

Participants emphasized the importance of understanding AI technologies. However, they distinguished between deep technical expertise and strategic understanding. Leaders do not need to write code or understand algorithms in detail, but they must grasp what AI can and cannot accomplish.

A Japanese manufacturing executive (P-J-07) explained: "I don't program the machines, but I need to know their capabilities and limitations. When my technical team proposes an AI solution, I must evaluate if it truly solves our business problem or if they are just excited about the technology."

A Vietnamese financial services leader (P-V-12) noted: "Many leaders approve AI projects without understanding what they're approving. This creates problems later when results don't match expectations. I spend time learning about the technology so I can ask good questions and make informed decisions."

Several participants described situations where insufficient technological understanding led to poor decisions. One Japanese retail leader (P-J-15) recalled: "We invested heavily in an AI recommendation system that our technical team assured us would transform customer experience. But we didn't understand the data requirements. When we discovered our data wasn't suitable, we had already committed significant resources."

Leaders who demonstrated stronger technological understanding reported more realistic expectations and better project outcomes. A Vietnamese technology executive (P-V-19) stated: "Understanding AI helped me set proper timelines. AI projects take longer than traditional IT projects because you need to train models, test them, and iterate. Leaders who don't understand this become impatient and kill projects prematurely."

The theme emerged consistently across 41 of 45 interviews (91%). Participants mentioned technological understanding an average of 4.8 times per interview, making it one of the most frequently discussed topics. Japanese leaders emphasized technical precision and detailed understanding, while Vietnamese leaders focused more on practical application and business value.

#### Theme 2: Change Leadership Determines Implementation Success

Every participant acknowledged that AI transformation requires substantial organizational change. Technical implementation represents only one aspect; changing processes, developing skills, and adapting culture prove equally important.

A Japanese healthcare leader (P-J-03) emphasized: "The technology works, but people don't use it. We implemented an AI diagnostic support system that could improve accuracy. However, doctors resisted because they felt the system questioned their expertise. We needed better change management from the beginning."

Vietnamese participants stressed communication aspects of change leadership. One banking executive (P-V-08) explained: "People fear AI will take their jobs. Leaders must communicate clearly about how AI will change work and help employees prepare. Without this communication, you face resistance that slows or stops transformation."

Several leaders described the importance of building coalitions and managing stakeholders. A Japanese manufacturing leader (P-J-11) noted: "Different groups have different concerns about AI. Engineers worry about complexity. Managers worry about cost. Workers worry about jobs. Leaders must address each group's concerns specifically."

Successful change leadership required patience and persistence. A Vietnamese retail leader (P-V-16) shared: "AI transformation doesn't happen overnight. Leaders must sustain effort over months and years. You face setbacks, and enthusiasm fades. Maintaining momentum requires constant attention."

Participants also highlighted the importance of pilot approaches. Starting with small projects, demonstrating wins, and building on success created better outcomes than attempting large-scale immediate transformation. This appeared in 38 of 45 interviews (84%).

#### Theme 3: Ethical Considerations Shape Trust and Sustainability

Ethical concerns about AI emerged prominently in interviews. Leaders recognized various ethical issues including data privacy, algorithmic bias, transparency, and social impact. However, approaches to these issues differed between countries.

Japanese leaders emphasized privacy and transparency more strongly. One financial services executive (P-J-14) explained: "Japanese customers value privacy highly. If they learn we use their data for AI without clear permission and explanation, we lose trust permanently. We must be transparent about what data we collect and how AI uses it."

Vietnamese leaders focused more on employment impacts. A manufacturing leader (P-V-05) stated: "When we introduce automation, workers worry about losing jobs. This creates social tension. We must consider not just company efficiency but also worker welfare and social stability."

Both groups recognized bias risks. A Japanese technology leader (P-J-21) noted: "AI learns from historical data. If that data contains bias, AI perpetuates and amplifies it. Leaders must ensure we test for bias and correct it before deploying systems."

Several participants described situations where inadequate attention to ethics created problems. A Vietnamese banking executive (P-V-13) recalled: "We launched an AI credit scoring system that denied loans to rural applicants at higher rates. The AI learned from historical patterns where urban borrowers repaid more reliably. But this created unfair discrimination. We had to revise the system significantly."

Leaders varied in how systematically they addressed ethics. Some organizations had established AI ethics committees and guidelines. Others handled ethical issues reactively as problems arose. Participants with more structured approaches reported greater confidence in their AI implementations. This theme appeared in 39 of 45 interviews (87%).

#### Theme 4: Continuous Learning Enables Adaptation

AI technologies evolve rapidly, creating a constant need for learning. Participants recognized that their current knowledge would quickly become outdated. Successful leaders demonstrated commitment to ongoing learning.

A Japanese retail executive (P-J-18) described their learning approach: "I dedicate several hours weekly to learning about AI developments. I read articles, attend seminars, and discuss with experts. This isn't a one-time learning but a continuous process."

Vietnamese leaders emphasized learning from failure. One technology leader (P-V-20) stated: "Our first AI projects failed. But we learned valuable lessons. Leaders who can't learn from failure will struggle with AI because early projects often don't succeed as planned."

Several participants joined peer learning groups. A Japanese manufacturing leader (P-J-09) explained: "I meet quarterly with leaders from other companies to share AI experiences. We learn more from these discussions than from consultants because we face similar challenges."

Some leaders sought diverse learning sources. A Vietnamese financial services executive (P-V-11) noted: "I learn from technical team members, from customers' reactions to AI, from academic research, and from observing other companies. No single source provides complete understanding."

Organizations that encouraged leader learning through formal training, conference attendance, and external networks reported faster AI adoption. Leaders in these organizations expressed greater confidence in their AI readiness. This theme was present in all 45 interviews (100%), making it the most universally recognized dimension.

#### Theme 5: Cultural Factors Shape Implementation Approaches

Participants clearly recognized how cultural factors influenced AI transformation. Japanese and Vietnamese leaders described different cultural challenges.

Japanese leaders emphasized the tension between hierarchy and digital expertise. One manufacturing executive (P-J-06) explained: "In Japanese companies, senior leaders make decisions based on their experience. But AI is new, and younger employees often understand it better. This creates tension. How do we respect seniority while leveraging younger employees' expertise?"

Risk aversion emerged as another Japanese challenge. A technology leader (P-J-22) stated: "Japanese culture values stability and avoiding mistakes. But AI requires experimentation, and some experiments fail. Leaders must create space for failure while managing cultural expectations."

Vietnamese leaders described challenges related to family business dynamics and relationship-based decision-making. One retail executive (P-V-14) noted: "Many Vietnamese companies are family-owned. AI decisions sometimes conflict with family preferences or traditional practices. Balancing modernization with respect for family authority requires careful navigation."

Rapid growth created both opportunities and challenges in Vietnam. A banking leader (P-V-09) explained: "Vietnam's economy grows quickly, creating pressure to adopt new technologies fast. This can push AI adoption before organizations are ready. Leaders must balance growth ambitions with realistic capability assessment."

Both groups noted that collectivist culture could support or hinder AI transformation. When leaders built consensus around AI benefits, collective culture facilitated implementation. When disagreement existed, consensus requirements slowed progress. This theme appeared in 43 of 45 interviews (96%).

#### Additional Dimensions Identified

Analysis revealed two additional dimensions beyond the four initially proposed: collaborative ecosystem building and strategic vision creation.

Collaborative ecosystem building involved developing partnerships with technology providers, research institutions, and other organizations. A Japanese healthcare leader (P-J-04) explained: "No company has all the AI expertise internally. We partner with universities for research, with technology companies for implementation, and with other hospitals to share learnings."

Strategic vision creation encompassed leaders' ability to articulate how AI would transform their business and guide long-term direction. A Vietnamese technology executive (P-V-21) noted: "Leaders must paint a picture of the AI-enabled future and explain how we'll get there. Without this vision, AI becomes disconnected technology projects rather than transformation."

However, after careful consideration and team discussion, the research team integrated these into existing dimensions. Collaborative ecosystem building fits within change management capability as it involves stakeholder engagement and partnership management. Strategic vision creation aligns with technological competence as it requires understanding AI's strategic potential and future trajectory.

#### Integration and Dimension Refinement

The four validated dimensions became:

1. **Technological Competence:** Understanding AI capabilities, limitations, strategic applications, and future vision

2. **Change Management Capability:** Planning change, engaging stakeholders, communicating effectively, managing resistance, building partnerships

3. **Ethical Awareness:** Recognizing ethical issues, applying ethical principles, ensuring fairness, maintaining transparency, considering social impact

4. **Adaptive Learning Orientation:** Committing to continuous learning, learning from failure, seeking diverse knowledge sources, adapting to change

These four dimensions emerged with clear distinctions while maintaining theoretical coherence. QualCoder analysis showed distinct code clusters for each dimension with minimal overlap (average cross-coding rate of 8.3%), supporting their conceptual independence.

### 4.3 Research Objective 2: Instrument Development and Validation

#### Item Generation and Refinement

Based on qualitative findings and literature review, the research team generated an initial pool of 48 items (12 per dimension). Expert review by five academics and five practitioners evaluated content validity. Experts rated each item's relevance and clarity on 5-point scales (1=Not Relevant/Clear, 5=Highly Relevant/Clear).

Content Validity Index (CVI) was calculated for each item:

**Formula 4.1: Content Validity Index**
```
I-CVI = Number of experts rating 4 or 5 / Total number of experts

S-CVI/Ave = Average of all I-CVI values

Acceptable thresholds:
I-CVI ≥ 0.78 for 10 experts (Polit & Beck, 2006)
S-CVI/Ave ≥ 0.90 for scale validity
```

Items with average relevance ratings below 4.0 (I-CVI < 0.80) or clarity ratings below 3.5 were revised or eliminated. This process reduced the item pool to 40 items (10 per dimension). The Scale-Level CVI averaged 0.93 across all items, indicating excellent content validity.

Pilot testing with 50 Japanese and 50 Vietnamese leaders assessed item performance. Participants completed the survey and provided feedback on clarity and relevance. Items showing poor distribution were identified using skewness and kurtosis:

**Formula 4.2: Skewness and Kurtosis**
```
Skewness = (N / ((N-1)(N-2))) × Σ((Xi - M) / SD)³

Kurtosis = (N(N+1) / ((N-1)(N-2)(N-3))) × Σ((Xi - M) / SD)⁴ - 3(N-1)² / ((N-2)(N-3))

Where:
N = Sample size
Xi = Individual observation
M = Mean
SD = Standard deviation

Problematic values:
|Skewness| > 2.0
|Kurtosis| > 7.0 (Curran et al., 1996)
```

Items with |skewness| > 2.0 or |kurtosis| > 7.0, or those identified as ambiguous in participant feedback, were further revised.

#### Exploratory Factor Analysis

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) used pilot data (n=100) to examine factor structure. Before conducting EFA, data suitability was assessed:

**Formula 4.3: Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) Test**
```
KMO = Σ Σi≠j r²ij / (Σ Σi≠j r²ij + Σ Σi≠j u²ij)

Where:
rij = Simple correlation between variables i and j
uij = Partial correlation between variables i and j

KMO interpretation:
≥ 0.90 = Marvelous
≥ 0.80 = Meritorious
≥ 0.70 = Middling
≥ 0.60 = Mediocre
< 0.60 = Unacceptable (Kaiser, 1974)
```

**Formula 4.4: Bartlett's Test of Sphericity**
```
χ² = -((N - 1) - (2p + 5)/6) × ln|R|

Where:
N = Sample size
p = Number of variables
|R| = Determinant of correlation matrix
df = p(p-1)/2

Significant χ² (p < .05) indicates correlations exist
among variables, supporting factor analysis
```

The pilot data showed KMO = 0.87 (meritorious) and Bartlett's test: χ²(780) = 2847.35, p < .001, confirming data suitability for factor analysis.

Principal axis factoring with promax rotation extracted factors using the eigenvalue > 1.0 criterion:

**Formula 4.5: Eigenvalue Calculation**
```
Eigenvalue λ = Σλi² / p

Where:
λi = Factor loading for item i
p = Number of items

Kaiser criterion: Retain factors with λ > 1.0
Scree plot: Retain factors before inflection point
Parallel analysis: Retain factors where observed λ > random λ
```

Four factors emerged with eigenvalues exceeding 1.0 (λ₁=11.34, λ₂=6.82, λ₃=4.57, λ₄=3.21), explaining 67.3% of total variance:

```
Variance explained:
Factor 1: 28.4% (11.34/40)
Factor 2: 17.1% (6.82/40)
Factor 3: 11.4% (4.57/40)
Factor 4: 10.4% (3.21/40)
Total: 67.3%
```

Factor loadings ranged from .52 to .89, with no substantial cross-loadings (< .30 on non-target factors). Pattern matrix rotation achieved simple structure with average primary loading of .74 and average cross-loading of .09.

Based on EFA results, 8 items were removed due to weak loadings (< .50) or cross-loadings (> .30 on non-target factors). The refined instrument contained 32 items (8 per dimension).

#### Confirmatory Factor Analysis

The large-scale survey collected 428 valid responses (213 from Japan, 215 from Vietnam). Table 4.2 summarizes sample characteristics.

**Table 4.2: Quantitative Sample Characteristics**

| Characteristic | Japan (n=213) | Vietnam (n=215) | Total (n=428) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Average Age | 44.3 (SD=7.6) | 38.6 (SD=7.1) | 41.4 (SD=7.9) |
| Gender (% Male) | 79.3% | 63.3% | 71.3% |
| Average Tenure (years) | 8.4 (SD=4.4) | 6.0 (SD=3.0) | 7.2 (SD=3.9) |
| **Position Level** | | | |
| Team Leader | 32.9% | 34.0% | 33.4% |
| Department Head | 43.2% | 43.3% | 43.2% |
| Senior Executive | 23.9% | 22.8% | 23.4% |
| **Industry** | | | |
| Financial Services | 20.2% | 27.4% | 23.8% |
| Healthcare | 14.1% | 12.6% | 13.3% |
| Manufacturing | 27.7% | 15.8% | 21.7% |
| Retail | 15.0% | 16.7% | 15.9% |
| Technology | 13.6% | 17.2% | 15.4% |
| Other | 9.4% | 10.2% | 9.8% |

The quantitative sample closely matches the target distribution. Average age across the full sample reached 41.4 years (SD=7.9), with Japanese respondents averaging 44.3 years and Vietnamese respondents 38.6 years. This 5.7-year difference remains statistically significant:

```
t-test calculation:
t = (44.3 - 38.6) / √((7.6²/213 + 7.1²/215))
t = 5.7 / √(0.271 + 0.234)
t = 5.7 / 0.711
t = 8.02, df = 426, p < .001

Cohen's d = (44.3 - 38.6) / √((7.6² + 7.1²)/2)
d = 5.7 / 7.35 = 0.78 (medium-large effect)
```

Male respondents comprised 71.3% of the total sample. Japan showed higher male representation (79.3%) compared to Vietnam (63.3%). This difference was statistically significant: χ²(1) = 13.47, p < .001, indicating Vietnam's greater progress toward gender diversity in leadership roles.

Leadership tenure averaged 7.2 years overall (SD=3.9). Japanese leaders averaged 8.4 years (SD=4.4), significantly longer than Vietnamese leaders at 6.0 years (SD=3.0):

```
t = (8.4 - 6.0) / √((4.4²/213 + 3.0²/215))
t = 2.4 / √(0.091 + 0.042)
t = 2.4 / 0.365
t = 6.58, df = 426, p < .001

Cohen's d = (8.4 - 6.0) / √((4.4² + 3.0²)/2)
d = 2.4 / 3.75 = 0.64 (medium effect)
```

Position level distribution remained consistent across countries (χ²(2) = 0.23, p = .89). Department heads represented the largest group (43.2%), followed by team leaders (33.4%) and senior executives (23.4%). This distribution ensured adequate representation across leadership levels.

Industry representation varied between countries (χ²(5) = 28.45, p < .001). Japanese respondents concentrated in manufacturing (27.7%), financial services (20.2%), and retail (15.0%). Vietnamese respondents showed stronger representation in financial services (27.4%), technology (17.2%), and retail (16.7%). These patterns mirror economic structure differences.

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) tested the four-factor measurement model using maximum likelihood estimation. The model specification included:

```
Four latent factors (ξ₁, ξ₂, ξ₃, ξ₄)
32 observed indicators (8 per factor)
32 error terms
Factor loadings (λ) estimated for all indicators
Factor correlations (φ) estimated
Error correlations set to zero (measurement independence)
```

The model showed acceptable fit based on multiple indices:

```
χ²(458) = 892.37, p < .001
CFI = .93 (> .90 threshold)
TLI = .92 (> .90 threshold)
RMSEA = .047 (< .08 threshold)
90% CI for RMSEA: [.043, .052]
SRMR = .052 (< .08 threshold)
```

The significant chi-square is expected given the sample size (N=428) and model complexity. Other fit indices meeting criteria indicate acceptable model fit. All factor loadings exceeded .70 and were statistically significant (p < .001):

```
Technological Competence: λ range .73 to .82, M = .78
Change Management Capability: λ range .77 to .85, M = .81
Ethical Awareness: λ range .72 to .81, M = .76
Adaptive Learning Orientation: λ range .74 to .84, M = .79
```

#### Reliability Assessment

**Table 4.3: Reliability Statistics**

| Dimension | Cronbach α (Japan) | Cronbach α (Vietnam) | Cronbach α (Overall) | Composite Reliability | AVE |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Technological Competence | 0.853 | 0.867 | 0.867 | 0.896 | 0.519 |
| Change Management Capability | 0.883 | 0.856 | 0.872 | 0.899 | 0.528 |
| Ethical Awareness | 0.798 | 0.853 | 0.831 | 0.871 | 0.458 |
| Adaptive Learning Orientation | 0.849 | 0.840 | 0.854 | 0.887 | 0.494 |

All dimensions demonstrated strong internal consistency. Cronbach's alpha calculations for the overall sample:

```
Technological Competence:
α = (8/(8-1)) × (1 - (3.42/15.67))
α = 1.143 × (1 - 0.218)
α = 1.143 × 0.782 = 0.867

Composite Reliability:
CR = (Σλ)² / ((Σλ)² + Σδ)
CR = (6.24)² / ((6.24)² + 2.14)
CR = 38.94 / (38.94 + 2.14) = 0.896

AVE = Σλ² / k
AVE = 4.15 / 8 = 0.519
```

The composite reliability of .896 exceeds the .70 threshold substantially, indicating excellent measurement consistency. AVE of .519 surpasses the .50 criterion, supporting convergent validity.

Change Management Capability showed the highest overall reliability (α=.872). Japan showed slightly higher reliability (.883) compared to Vietnam (.856), though both exceeded acceptable thresholds:

```
Composite Reliability = 0.899
AVE = 4.22 / 8 = 0.528
```

Ethical Awareness displayed adequate reliability (α=.831), though slightly lower than other dimensions. Japan showed lower reliability (.798) compared to Vietnam (.853):

```
Japan α difference: 0.853 - 0.798 = 0.055
This suggests some cultural differences in ethical 
awareness manifestation, but both remain acceptable.

Composite Reliability = 0.871
AVE = 3.66 / 8 = 0.458
```

The AVE of .458 falls marginally below the .50 threshold but remains within acceptable ranges (Fornell & Larcker, 1981) given the construct's conceptual complexity and adequate composite reliability.

Adaptive Learning Orientation achieved strong reliability (α=.854) with consistent performance across Japan (.849) and Vietnam (.840):

```
Composite Reliability = 0.887
AVE = 3.95 / 8 = 0.494
```

The reliability patterns indicate that all four dimensions constitute well-defined constructs. The slight variations between countries indicate some cultural nuances without undermining overall measurement quality.

#### Discriminant Validity

**Table 4.4: Discriminant Validity Assessment**

| Dimension | TC | CMC | EA | ALO |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Technological Competence (TC) | **[0.72]** | | | |
| Change Management Capability (CMC) | 0.38 | **[0.73]** | | |
| Ethical Awareness (EA) | 0.47 | 0.40 | **[0.68]** | |
| Adaptive Learning Orientation (ALO) | 0.38 | 0.55 | 0.35 | **[0.70]** |

*Note: Diagonal elements (bold) are square roots of AVE. Off-diagonal elements are inter-construct correlations.*

Discriminant validity assessment shows that each dimension's square root of AVE exceeds its correlations with other constructs:

```
Technological Competence:
√AVE = √0.519 = 0.72
Highest correlation = 0.47 (with EA)
0.72 > 0.47 ✓ Discriminant validity supported

Change Management Capability:
√AVE = √0.528 = 0.73
Highest correlation = 0.55 (with ALO)
0.73 > 0.55 ✓ Discriminant validity supported

Ethical Awareness:
√AVE = √0.458 = 0.68
Highest correlation = 0.47 (with TC)
0.68 > 0.47 ✓ Discriminant validity supported

Adaptive Learning Orientation:
√AVE = √0.494 = 0.70
Highest correlation = 0.55 (with CMC)
0.70 > 0.55 ✓ Discriminant validity supported
```

The correlation pattern reveals theoretically meaningful relationships. Change Management Capability correlates most strongly with Adaptive Learning Orientation (r=.55), suggesting that leaders who embrace learning adapt change processes more effectively. The correlation remains below the discriminant validity threshold, confirming they represent distinct constructs.

Technological Competence shows moderate correlation with Ethical Awareness (r=.47), indicating that technical understanding enables more sophisticated ethical reasoning about AI applications. Leaders who understand how AI systems work can better identify potential ethical issues.

All correlations remain moderate (.35 to .55), indicating related but separable constructs. The heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio was also calculated as an alternative discriminant validity criterion:

**Formula 4.6: HTMT Ratio**
```
HTMT = Mean of heterotrait-heteromethod correlations /
        Geometric mean of average monotrait-heteromethod correlations

HTMT < 0.85 for discriminant validity (Henseler et al., 2015)
HTMT < 0.90 for conceptually distinct constructs
```

All HTMT values ranged from 0.41 to 0.63, well below the 0.85 threshold, providing additional discriminant validity support.

#### Measurement Invariance

Multi-group CFA tested measurement invariance across Japan and Vietnam using sequential constraint testing. The baseline configural model estimated all parameters freely in both groups:

**Table 4.4a: Measurement Invariance Testing Results**

| Model | χ² | df | CFI | RMSEA | ΔCFI | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Configural (same structure) | 1654.23 | 916 | .92 | .045 | - | Baseline |
| Metric (equal loadings) | 1698.14 | 944 | .917 | .045 | .003 | Accepted |
| Scalar (equal intercepts) | 1786.52 | 972 | .911 | .046 | .006 | Partial |
| Partial Scalar (26/32 equal) | 1742.36 | 970 | .912 | .045 | .005 | Accepted |

Results showed:

**Configural invariance** (same structure): χ²(916) = 1654.23, CFI = .92, RMSEA = .045. The four-factor structure fit adequately in both groups, establishing baseline model.

**Metric invariance** (equal loadings): χ²(944) = 1698.14, CFI = .917. Comparison with configural model:

```
Δχ² = 1698.14 - 1654.23 = 43.91
Δdf = 944 - 916 = 28
ΔCFI = .917 - .920 = .003

ΔCFI < .010 threshold (Cheung & Rensvold, 2002)
Metric invariance supported
```

**Scalar invariance** (equal intercepts): χ²(972) = 1786.52, CFI = .911. Comparison with metric model:

```
Δχ² = 1786.52 - 1698.14 = 88.38
Δdf = 972 - 944 = 28
ΔCFI = .911 - .917 = .006

ΔCFI = .006 approaches .010 threshold
Full scalar invariance marginally rejected
```

**Partial scalar invariance** was established by freeing intercepts for 6 items showing non-invariance (2 from Ethical Awareness, 2 from Technological Competence, 1 from Change Management, 1 from Adaptive Learning):

```
Modified Scalar: χ²(970) = 1742.36, CFI = .912
Comparison with metric model:
Δχ² = 1742.36 - 1698.14 = 44.22
Δdf = 970 - 944 = 26
ΔCFI = .912 - .917 = .005

ΔCFI < .010 threshold
Partial scalar invariance supported (26/32 items invariant)
```

Partial scalar invariance with 81% of items (26/32) showing invariance exceeds the minimum requirement of 2 items per construct (Byrne et al., 1989) and justifies meaningful mean comparisons between countries. The six non-invariant items were excluded from latent mean comparisons.

### 4.4 Research Objective 3: Comparing Japanese and Vietnamese Leadership Readiness

#### Descriptive Statistics

**Table 4.5: Leadership Readiness Dimension Means by Country**

| Dimension | Japan Mean | Japan SD | Vietnam Mean | Vietnam SD | t-statistic | p-value | Cohen's d |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Technological Competence | 4.18 | 0.74 | 3.80 | 0.77 | 5.17 | 3.7E-07 | 0.50 |
| Change Management Capability | 3.82 | 0.80 | 4.16 | 0.75 | -4.52 | 7.93E-06 | -0.44 |
| Ethical Awareness | 4.18 | 0.64 | 3.90 | 0.75 | 4.07 | 5.56E-05 | 0.39 |
| Adaptive Learning Orientation | 3.63 | 0.75 | 4.05 | 0.71 | -6.00 | 4.15E-09 | -0.58 |

*Note: Scales range from 1 (low readiness) to 7 (high readiness). Effect sizes: .20 = small, .50 = medium, .80 = large (Cohen, 1988).*

MANOVA revealed significant overall differences between countries:

```
Wilks' Lambda calculation:
Λ = |E| / |H + E| = 0.85

F-approximation:
F = ((1 - 0.85) / 0.85) × ((428 - 4 - 1) / 4)
F = (0.15 / 0.85) × (423 / 4)
F = 0.176 × 105.75
F = 18.74

df₁ = 4, df₂ = 423
p < .001

Partial η² = 1 - Λ = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15
```

This multivariate effect indicates that country membership explains 15% of variance in the combined readiness dimensions, representing a medium-to-large effect. Follow-up univariate tests confirmed significant differences on all four dimensions.

**Technological Competence** showed Japanese leaders scoring significantly higher (M=4.18, SD=0.74) than Vietnamese leaders (M=3.80, SD=0.77):

```
Pooled SD: sp = √(((213-1)×0.74² + (215-1)×0.77²) / (213+215-2))
sp = √((156.91 + 127.13) / 426) = √0.667 = 0.817

t = (4.18 - 3.80) / (0.817 × √(1/213 + 1/215))
t = 0.38 / (0.817 × 0.0684)
t = 0.38 / 0.0735
t = 5.17, df = 426, p = 3.7×10⁻⁷

Cohen's d = (4.18 - 3.80) / 0.817 = 0.50 (medium effect)
```

The effect size of d=0.50 represents a medium-sized difference. This pattern aligns with Japan's advanced technological infrastructure, strong engineering education tradition, and decades of industrial automation experience.

**Change Management Capability** revealed the opposite pattern, with Vietnamese leaders scoring higher (M=4.16, SD=0.75) than Japanese leaders (M=3.82, SD=0.80):

```
Pooled SD: sp = √(((213-1)×0.80² + (215-1)×0.75²) / 426)
sp = √((135.68 + 120.75) / 426) = 0.775

t = (3.82 - 4.16) / (0.775 × √(1/213 + 1/215))
t = -0.34 / (0.775 × 0.0684)
t = -0.34 / 0.0530
t = -4.52, df = 426, p = 7.93×10⁻⁶

Cohen's d = (3.82 - 4.16) / 0.775 = -0.44 (medium effect)
```

The effect size of d=-0.44 indicates a medium-sized difference favoring Vietnamese leaders. This finding reflects Vietnam's recent history of rapid economic transformation requiring continuous organizational adaptation.

**Ethical Awareness** showed Japanese leaders scoring higher (M=4.18, SD=0.64) than Vietnamese leaders (M=3.90, SD=0.75):

```
Pooled SD: sp = √(((213-1)×0.64² + (215-1)×0.75²) / 426)
sp = √((87.05 + 120.75) / 426) = 0.697

t = (4.18 -
